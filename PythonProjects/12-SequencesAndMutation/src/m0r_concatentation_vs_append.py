"""
This module compares two ways of appending items to a list:
    r = r + [item]
    r.append(item)
Run this module to see which is faster, and how much so!

# TODO: 2. With your instructor, read the code below, where you will see
#  two functions each of which produces the list [1, 2, 3, ... n],
#  for any given n.  Run this module, then answer these questions:
#    Which runs faster:
#       the CONCATENATION approach or the APPEND approach?
#    The slower approach takes about how times as many seconds
#    as the faster approach,
#        for a list of size 10,000?
#        for a list of size 20,000?
#        for a list of size 40,000?
#        for a list of size 80,000?
#    Do not RUN the code but take a wild guess at:
#        for a list of size 1,000,000?
