"""
Capstone Team Project.  Code to run on a LAPTOP (NOT the robot).

This code contains the one and only  MAIN  function for running on the laptop.

This code:
  1. Displays and runs the Graphical User Interface (GUI), and
  2. Talks to the robot (by sending MQTT messages) through the GUI, and
  3. Listens for messages from the robot in the background, and
  4. Acts upon any such messages via its DelegateForLaptopCode object.

In particular, this code constructs the one and only   tkinter.Tk   object
and runs  mainloop   on it.  It obtains most of its GUI (including callbacks)
from calling:
  m1_laptop_code.get_my_frame
  m2_laptop_code.get_my_frame
  m3_laptop_code.get_my_frame
  m4_laptop_code.get_my_frame
and displaying the frames thereby obtained.
Hence, most of the "action" really happens in the mX_laptop_code modules.

This code uses what is called "multiple inheritance" to allow the 4 modules
to each have their own "delegate" class in their own modules (and hence
to reduce the likelihood of GIT conflicts).  Your professor will explain
how this fits into your own code when talking about this framework and MQTT.

Authors:  Your professors (for the framework)
    and PUT_YOUR_NAMES_HERE.
