"""
Capstone Team Project.  Code to run on the EV3 robot (NOT on a laptop).

This code contains the one and only  MAIN  function for running on the robot.

This code constructs a robot with an associated MQTT object and runs an
infinite loop while listening for messages from the laptop and responding to
them via its "delegate" object.

This code uses what is called "multiple inheritance" to allow the 4 modules
to each have their own "delegate" class in their own modules (and hence
to reduce the likelihood of GIT conflicts).  Your professor will explain
how this fits into your own code when talking about this framework and MQTT.

Authors:  Your professors (for the framework)
    and PUT_YOUR_NAMES_HERE.
Fall term, 2019-2020.
