"""
Capstone Team Project.  Code to run on a ROBOT (NOT a laptop).

This module intentionally has NO   main   function.

Instead, the one and only   main   function for ROBOT code is in module
  m0_run_this_on_ROBOT
When  m0_run_this_on_ROBOT  runs, it calls its   main   to construct a robot
(with associated objects) and sits in an infinite loop waiting to RECEIVE
messages from the LAPTOP code.  When the   m0_run_this_on_ROBOT   code receives
a message from the LAPTOP that is destined for YOUR "delegate" code, it calls
the relevant method which YOU define in the  MyRobotDelegate  class below.

See the doc-string in    m0_run_this_on_ROBOT   for details.
Your professor will explain further when talking about MQTT and this code.

Authors:  Your professors (for the framework)
    and PUT_YOUR_NAME_HERE.
